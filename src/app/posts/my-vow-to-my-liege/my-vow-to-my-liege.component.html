  <p>I marathoned this game, so needless to say, I LOVED IT!!! Quick details if you're not familiar with My Vow To My Liege at all. It's a historical ancient Chinese setting with the imperial court political intrigue that you see often in CN dramas! The MC/heroine's default name is Tengyu and her default nickname is Ah Yu. (This is voiced by the LIs!) Due to certain circumstances (discovered in the first 10 minutes of the common route) Tengyu has to disguise herself as a man in the imperial court. She's also been cursed by a dragon god, but that's neither here nor there in the land of ~otome~.</p>
  <p>There are 4 love interests and each route was <app-spoiler-text [majorSpoiler]="false" tooltip="LI route length">2 to 3 hours</app-spoiler-text> long. For reference, the common route took me about <app-spoiler-text [majorSpoiler]="false" tooltip="common route length">10 hours</app-spoiler-text>, though I did pause a lot during the common route to talk to friends about the game and screenshotting every 10 seconds. Normally I'm a pretty fast reader and my play time is faster than the VNDB averages.</p>
  <p>System stuff, there's no voice playback or rewind in the text log, you can't modify how loud the sfx are (but you can for voices and bgm) which is something I like to do because I often find them too loud. I did notice typos but I found the text readable and did not disrupt the flow of the game for me.</p>
  <p>I really enjoyed Tengyu as an otome MC! Usually otome MCs fall under the yamato nadeshiko trope, though I guess that's pretty common for JP joseimuke material in general, I can vibe with this but dynamic otome MCs are so wonderful to experience as you can feel their impact on the story/plot! I think she had great chemistry with each LI and I was really sold on each route in terms of the romance. The plot was also great, though I kind of wish we had extra chapters, DLC, or even an FD/sequel.</p>
  <p>The LIs were also very well written, I have a bias for Yiguang and Goujian which I'll get to in a minute!! Zixu was very much not my type, but the writing of his route sold me! I also just have a soft spot for Chenfeng's trope so I folded there too. Usually I have that one otome LI out of the cast of 5-6 that I just <i>don't really care for</i>. But this was not the case for MVTML!</p>

  <h2>Routes, Characters, and Spoilers</h2>
  <h3>Goujian</h3>
  <app-spoiler-image [majorSpoiler]="false" imgSrc="/yumearu/goujian1.png" tooltip="mid-late common route dialogue - I love him so much AUGH"></app-spoiler-image>
  <app-spoiler-text [majorSpoiler]="true" tooltip="spoilers on the entire route and endings">WHERE DO I BEGIN, what a banger for my first route!! His route was just so emotionally intense and I fully empathize with both Goujian (Ah Jiu) and Tengyu's (Ah Yu) actions!!! But I'm really craving an extra/bonus story (or even a full on FD ðŸ‘€) of Ah Yu doting on Ah Jiu, because heavens he has been through a lot (ok maybe he did betray her way too many times) but going through his dream past just hurt me so bad.</app-spoiler-text>
  <p>I highly, highly recommend his route. He is destined to be the fan favorite with how good his route is!</p>
