  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>Hi! This is my otome game diary. I write about otome games that I've played, sometimes RPGs if I feel like it. There will be spoilers (tagged) and/or CGs (mostly from promotional material).</p>
  <p>I've played otome games for 3 years now. I got into otome during university and I've since graduated and work as a software engineer, so I'm able to fund my hobbies!!</p>
