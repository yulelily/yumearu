  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>Hi! This is my otome game diary. I write about otome games that I've played, sometimes RPGs if I feel like it. There will be spoilers (tagged) and/or CGs (mostly from promotional material).</p>
  <p>I've played otome games for 3 years now. I got into otome during university and I've since graduated and work as a software engineer, so I'm able to fund my hobbies!!</p>
  <h1>Spoilers</h1>
  <h3>Spoiler Text</h3>
  <p>Spoiler text will be tagged as such and display a warning with information on the spoiler beforehand.</p>
  <p><app-spoiler-text tooltip="single exclamation mark is a minor spoiler, click to reveal" [majorSpoiler]="false">sample minor spoiler text ðŸ¤—</app-spoiler-text></p>
  <p><app-spoiler-text tooltip="double exclamation mark is a major spoiler, click to reveal" [majorSpoiler]="true">sample major spoiler text ðŸ˜±</app-spoiler-text></p>
  <h3>Spoiler Image</h3>
  <p>Similarly to spoiler text, images will be tagged as such and display a warning with information on the spoiler beforehand. I will try and stick to only promotional images for CGs, but may include dialogue in the routes.</p>
